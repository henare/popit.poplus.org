The PopIt documentation has two sections, hosted and self-hosted. If you're just starting out then you probably want to use the hosted version of PopIt and let us take care of hosting the software and storing the data.

However, if you've got a more advanced use case, or you can't use our hosted version of PopIt for one reason or another then you'll probably want to self-host PopIt on your own servers.
